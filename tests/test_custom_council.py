"""The custom VC council: does it DISCRIMINATE, or is it decorative?

This codebase has repeatedly shipped code that looks implemented and measures nothing —
a metric returning a confident 1.0, a substance rule reading payload keys that did not
exist, `axis_spreads` identically 0.0 because the bear was handed the bull's numbers. The
equivalent failure here would be five lenses producing the same contribution, or a
personal rank that is always the core rank.

So the load-bearing tests in this file are the ones that build TWO profiles out of real
survey answers and real decision rows, run both over the same evidence, and assert the
rankings differ in a way the lens weights explain. Everything else guards an invariant:
same evidence graph, core score untouched, no invented lens, no silent zero, and no
recommendation without a bear case.
