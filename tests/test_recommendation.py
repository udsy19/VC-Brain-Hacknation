"""The $100K answer: a computed cheque and a confidence with a stated basis.

Every test here is behavioural — it asserts what the recommender DECIDES, not that a
key exists. The failure mode these guard against is the one two audits already found in
this codebase: a field that is always populated, always plausible, and measures nothing.

Fully offline: the screening and the gate are injected, so nothing dials out.
