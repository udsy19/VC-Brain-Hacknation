"""End-to-end verification against the RUNNING system.

Why this exists: the unit suite went green while the backtest never called the
scorer, the API served authored fixtures as computed output, a substance rule read
payload keys that did not exist and fired for nobody, and a metric returned a
confident 1.0 while measuring nothing. Every one of those bugs had the same shape —
a function existed, so it looked implemented, and nothing ever asked whether its
output meant anything.

So the rule here is: assert on OUTPUTS, and prove they came from the engine rather
than from a fixture. A check that a field is present proves nothing; a check that
the field DISAGREES with the seed file, or moves when the inputs move, proves the
computation ran.

    uv run python scripts/verify_demo.py            # against localhost:8000
    uv run python scripts/verify_demo.py --api URL  # against a deployment

Exit code is the number of failures, so CI and pre-demo checks can gate on it.
