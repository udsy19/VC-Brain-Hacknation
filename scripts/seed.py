    Refs stay anchored to the FIXTURE index, never to position in the output: sanitizing
    emits extra INTEGRITY events, and a positional ref would silently renumber every
    event after the first injection — breaking the trace drill-down that the demo clicks.

    Fixture text is authored UNSANITIZED on purpose (the adversarial deck really does
    carry an injection on slide 7) — detection is the pipeline's job, not the
    fixture's. This function is where that job gets done: seeding wrote Events
    straight to the store without ever passing them through the funnel, so the
    injection landed in production with integrity_flags=[] and there were zero
    INTEGRITY events in the whole database. Every seeded event now takes the same
    sanitizer every scanner takes, and the strip is recorded as a real detection.

    `shift` overrides the corpus-wide date shift. The backtest cohort passes
    timedelta(0): its dates ARE the claim ("we would have seen this in 2013"), so
    moving them forward to keep a demo warm would destroy the thing being tested.
