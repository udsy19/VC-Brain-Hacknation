/**
 * Route `/pipeline` — the working dashboard.
 *
 * ONE query control → ranked list with per-axis scores and momentum. Renders on
 * fixtures if the backend is down.
 *
 * The page used to stack two controls: a structured thesis panel and a
 * natural-language box. Collapsing them to one input forced a semantic choice, because
 * they were never the same operation:
 *
 *   THESIS  (`core/thesis.in_scope`) EXCLUDES companies from the pipeline. A sector
 *           dropped there stops being sourced at all.
 *   QUERY   (`GET /query`) only FILTERS the already-screened list. It dims rows.
 *
 * The single box on this page is a FILTER, and it says so. A VC typing "seed-stage
 * fintech in Europe, cheque under $2M" means "narrow what I am looking at", not
 * "permanently rewrite my fund's mandate". The standing thesis is real state and still
 * exists — it moved to `/thesis` — and a query can be promoted into it only through the
 * explicit action below the readback, never as a side effect of typing.
 *
 * Three further things are non-negotiable here:
 *
 *   1. The in-flight state is VISIBLE and BOUNDED — a progress bar, a stated reason for
 *      the disabled button, and a hard timeout in the client. There is no path where the
 *      button greys out and stays that way.
 *   2. The loading flag is cleared in a `finally`, and the query call itself cannot
 *      reject, so a failure surfaces as an error with a retry rather than as a dead control.
 *   3. Zero results are an ANSWER, not a failure. The readback of what the query was
 *      understood to mean is shown either way, and the empty state says so plainly.
