/**
 * The personalisation client: session, VC profile, survey, decisions, gap, personal rank.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `lib/api.ts`. That module is fallback-first: when the backend is
 * unreachable it serves hand-authored fixtures so the objective product still renders.
 * That contract is exactly wrong here. A fixture profile is an INVENTED profile, and the
 * one rule this feature cannot break is that everything on screen about the user is
 * something the user actually submitted (docs/DIFFERENTIATOR.md §2.2 — a profile
 * inferred from four decisions must say so). So this module has no fixtures at all: a
 * failed call returns `{ ok: false, error }` and the page renders the failure, never a
 * plausible persona.
 *
 * What it shares with `lib/api.ts` is the transport discipline: NOTHING HERE REJECTS.
 * Every function resolves to a discriminated result, so no caller can be left with a
 * disabled button and nothing on screen to explain it.
 *
 * Two transport rules, both load-bearing:
 *   - `credentials: "include"` on every call. The session is an httpOnly cookie, so it
 *     is invisible to JS and travels only if the fetch asks for it. One missing flag
 *     here makes every authenticated route return 401 while login looks like it worked.
 *   - A 401 is a STATE, not an error. It means "anonymous", which is a legitimate,
 *     fully-rendering path (§1). Callers distinguish it via `status`.
