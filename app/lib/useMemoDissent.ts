/**
 * One memo/dissent load, shared by the two places that render it.
 *
 * The recommendation now leads the page (it is decision input #1) while the memo|dissent
 * split view stays where it is. Both need the same lock state, and the lock is the thing
 * that must not be duplicated: two independent fetches would mean two independent ideas
 * of whether the dissent had been served, and the first one to unlock would make the
 * other look wrong. So the state lives here, once, and both consumers read it.
 *
 * The lock itself is still the SERVER'S. This hook never sets `recommendation` locally;
 * it re-requests the memo with `dissent_viewed=true` and renders whatever comes back. If
 * the server keeps withholding, the page keeps showing the padlock.
