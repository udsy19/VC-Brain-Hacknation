"""The custom VC council — personas instantiated from a VC profile (DIFFERENTIATOR §3).

THE ARCHITECTURAL RULE (§0), which every function here is arranged around:

    The personal layer sits ON TOP of the core rank. It never modifies the core score.

Two VCs must see the same objective truth and a different ranking. If preference moved
the core score, the same founder would be *more capable* at a bolder fund, which is
nonsense — the thesis engine already avoids exactly this by moving the evidence bar
rather than the score. So nothing in this module writes to a `ScreeningResult`, emits an
`Event`, or feeds back into `memory.score`. It reads the core numbers, reweights them
through lenses that are attributable to profile fields, and reports both orderings side
by side.

THE SECOND RULE, inherited from the dissent engine's bug: the council runs on the SAME
evidence graph as the core analysis, filtered by `intelligence.flags.is_impeached` — the
same filter every other module uses. The bear case was once blind to 20-25% of what the
memo could see, so bull and bear argued about different facts. The council gets no
private evidence, and nothing is withheld from it.

THE THIRD RULE, inherited from `memory/profiles.py`: a lens with no derivable
justification is NOT invented. If the profile supports two lenses, two lenses are
produced and `lenses_not_derived` says which were skipped and why. A lens that cannot
read a company (an unknown sector against a sector prior) ABSTAINS visibly and its
weight is redistributed — it never contributes a silent 0.0, which would be a penalty
dressed up as a measurement.
