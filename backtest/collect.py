"""Early-footprint collection for the time machine. Owner: D. See D.md H1-3.

Collect a founder's pre-breakout signals and TRUNCATE them at an explicit date. The
truncation date is recorded on every record — it is the thing that makes the replay a
backtest rather than a retelling, so it is never implicit and never defaulted.

Live scanners when B's are importable; otherwise the hand-collected fixture cohort in
data/seed/backtest.json. Collection is manual and slow; that is why it starts at H1.
