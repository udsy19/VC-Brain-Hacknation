    hidden(v) = z(ppr(v)) - z(visibility(v))

High proximity to greatness, low individual visibility = the founder nobody emailed.
Edges are observed_at-stamped and MUST be as_of-filterable — the backtest replays this.

Edges are derived from co-membership in a *group* rather than from explicit pair lists,
because an Event carries exactly one entity_id: two people are linked when both have an
event pointing at the same repo / paper / thread. An edge's observed_at is therefore the
LATER of the two sides (the collaboration is not observable until both halves exist) —
stamping it with the earlier side would leak an edge into the past and quietly invalidate
every backtest claim built on it.

Payload keys are read tolerantly: the scanners are being written in parallel, so an
unfamiliar shape is skipped, never fatal.
