"""Recursive research: plan queries -> fetch -> extract -> name the gap -> query again.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `core/search.py` is single-shot, which is exactly why the registry caps
Tavily at tier 4 `enrichment_only` — "discovery, never evidence". One query cannot
establish enough to promote a finding. A loop that ingests what it found, notices what is
still unknown, and asks again is how a discovery becomes evidence: the second round is
what turns "a URL that mentions this name" into "a fetched document, quoted at an offset,
attributed to a resolved person".

WHAT THE MODEL DOES, AND WHAT IT NEVER DOES. The model writes queries and names gaps.
It never decides what is true, and it never emits a URL. More model-generated queries
must not create more places to fabricate, so the anti-hallucination property is
structural exactly as in `sourcing/outreach.py`:

  - documents reach the model keyed by opaque ids (`d1`, `d2`, ...), never by URL
  - URL-shaped text is redacted OUT of every excerpt before it reaches `llm.complete`,
    in-place and same-length, so offsets into the stored body still line up
  - the model returns an id and a quote; code resolves id -> fetch -> URL afterwards
  - a quote that does not appear literally in the redacted body, or that straddles a
    redacted link, is DROPPED. Not flagged, not repaired — dropped.

FOUR BOUNDS, all named below with their rationale, plus loop-until-dry: a round that
adds no new fetch ends the loop regardless of how much budget is left. `/dissent` already
measures 17s; unbounded recursion is unbounded cost.

ENTITY DRIFT is the failure this design exists to prevent. A recursive search on a common
name will confidently assemble a composite person who does not exist, with citations.
`memory/resolver.py` already settled that name similarity cannot merge on its own — it
measured Jaro-Winkler scoring two genuinely different people at 0.941, HIGHER than a true
transliterated pair at 0.939, which is why name weight is capped and merging needs a
handle, an email or a co-occurrence. So there is NO name matcher in this file. Every
fetched document goes through `resolver.resolve()` and all three outcomes are honoured:
MERGED onto the subject becomes evidence; AMBIGUOUS is retained but NOT attributed;
NEW — and MERGED onto somebody else — is a different person and is not attached.

CORROBORATION-ONLY SOURCES. A source the registry marks `scoring_eligible: false`
(TechCrunch) may corroborate a claim and may never score one. That is enforced by type:
its documents can only ever become a `Corroboration`, which has no `to_event()` and no
`entity_id`, and `Finding.from_fetch` REFUSES to construct from such a fetch. Corroborated
text therefore has no path into the event store, and every scoring surface — the green
flag rules, the founder score's observation kinds, and the axis judge's event snippets —
reads the event store. See `intelligence/validator.py` for the one legitimate consumer.

    Which hosts encode a handle is the resolver's knowledge, and it stays there: a second
    list of profile-URL shapes in this file would be one more thing to keep in sync.

    Both of the resolver's extractors are consulted, because they cover different shapes
    and `resolve()` itself uses both — `url_identity` supplies the strong aliases that can
    merge on their own, `_url_key` supplies the fuzzy-scoring keys and recognises handle
    forms (a `user?id=` query string, for one) that `url_identity` reads as a plain page.
    Asking only the first silently drops a real handle, which downgrades a document about
    the founder to AMBIGUOUS — safe, but wrong, and indistinguishable from real doubt.

    SAME-HOST LINKS ARE CHROME UNLESS THE DOCUMENT'S OWN URL CORROBORATES THEM, and that
    rule is the difference between this working and this being actively dangerous. Every
    single-segment github.com path parses as a handle, so a repo page's navigation hands
    the resolver `login`, `features`, `pricing` and `sponsors` as identifiers. Feeding
    those in means a real founder's page carries a dozen identifiers belonging to nobody,
    several entities match at once, and `resolve()` correctly returns AMBIGUOUS or merges
    onto whichever junk entity was created first. The live run did exactly this: it
    rejected `github.com/simonw/datasette` — the subject's OWN repository — as drift.

    So a SAME-HOST link must have its first path segment corroborated by the document's
    own URL. `github.com/simonw` and `github.com/simonw/datasette` on a page at
    `github.com/simonw/datasette` are the author and their repository;
    `github.com/features/actions` and `github.com/login` are the navigation bar. Without
    this the cap fills with chrome before any real identifier is reached, and the live run
    proved the consequence: `resolve()` merged the subject's OWN repository page onto a
    junk entity by co-occurrence across nine GitHub product URLs.

    UNAMBIGUOUSLY PERSON-SHAPED URLs are exempt, because their shape already names a
    person and no corroboration is needed: `/user?id=`, `linkedin.com/in/`,
    `twitter.com/<x>`, `<x>.github.io`. Requiring corroboration from those too would drop
    the author link on a discussion thread, which is the single most useful identity
    signal such a page has.
