"""Investment memo. Owner: D. See D.md H8-12.

Five required sections: Thesis, Founder, Market, Risks, Recommendation.

The rule that matters: GAPS ARE FLAGGED, NEVER FILLED. "No independent revenue
verification attempted" is a feature, not a hole. A memo that fabricates to look
complete loses the trust criterion outright.

So gaps and citations are computed in Python from the evidence graph, and only the
prose is delegated to the model. The model cannot invent a citation it wasn't given,
and it cannot close a gap the validator left open.
