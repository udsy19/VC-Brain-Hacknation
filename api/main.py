"""FastAPI app. Owner: D. Thin — it calls into memory/sourcing/intelligence, nothing more.

Every route calls the real module where it exists and falls back to a fixture where it
doesn't (see routers/deps.degrade). D never blocks on anyone, and the app
always starts: a route that 500s at hour 23 is a dead demo beat.
