"""The thesis engine — S0. Config, not code.

The spec's first stage is "config not code: sectors, stage, geo, check size, risk
appetite". `data/seed/thesis.json` was rich and complete, and NOTHING READ IT. The
API served it over GET, the dashboard rendered it and let you edit it, and every
downstream decision ignored every field. `ranking_policy` was even duplicated as a
literal in the API rather than read from here. Editing the thesis changed nothing,
which makes it a picture of a control panel.

This module is the reader. It is deliberately the ONLY place that interprets the
file, so "what does the thesis actually change?" has one answer.

What it governs, and what it explicitly does not:

  SECTORS        in-scope sectors, with weights. Out-of-scope companies are
                 EXCLUDED FROM THE PIPELINE, not scored down — a fund that does not
                 invest in a sector does not rank it lower, it does not look at it.
  STAGE          same treatment.
  GEO            deliberately unrestricted by default, and the config says why:
                 "geographic filters are the cheapest way to systematically miss
                 the Type 6 founder". Honoured, but a filter set here is applied.
  CHECK_SIZE     min/target/max, read by the recommendation.
  RISK_APPETITE  0..1, where 1 is pre-product technical conviction. Moves the
                 EVIDENCE BAR, not the score: a high-risk-appetite fund proceeds on
                 thinner evidence. It must never move the score itself, or the same
                 founder would be more capable at a bolder fund, which is nonsense.

Never touches: the founder score, the green-flag rules, or anything a founder is
measured by. The thesis says what WE are looking for. It does not get to change
what is true about them.

    the file, editing the thesis would change what the panel displays and nothing else,
    which is precisely the "picture of a control panel" this module was written to end.

    An explicit `path` forces the file, because a caller naming a file means a file. So
    does VCBRAIN_SEED_DIR, for the reason seed_path() already gives: a test pointing at a
    tmp fixture must not silently assert against the production config. That rule was
    written about the hardcoded file path and it applies unchanged to the stored
